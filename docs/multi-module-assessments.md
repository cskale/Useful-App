# Multi-Module Assessments

This project is evolving toward supporting assessments that span one or more modules.  
The data model introduces a parent **assessment run** containing one or more module sessions.  
Rules allow computing an overall weighted score across modules.

This document captures the early design for multi-module flows and scoring.
